      <description>Day 5 of 107 Today is the fifth day of the #107DaysofCode.
What Did I Learn Today? Using Git for project management.
Today I made progress in my Vim journey. Vim is a great text editor. I think its time I moved from Emacs to Vim permanently.
Data Science - Much of my days work involves alot of data science work, I have managed to automate most processes at work</description>
