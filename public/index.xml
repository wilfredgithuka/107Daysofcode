      <description>Day 1 of 107 The project has already began.
There are alot of similar project online mostly about 100DaysofCode.
The goal of my project is not only learning coding skills but also the necessary tools and soft skills that come along with it.
I will start off with 1.5 hours of coding per day and progress on with it.
The best way to learn something is to play with it.</description>
