## Day 5 of 107

Today is the fifth day of the #107DaysofCode.

## What Did I Learn Today?

* Using Git for project management.
* Today I made progress in my Vim journey. Vim is a great text editor. I think its time I moved from Emacs to Vim permanently.
* Data Science - Much of my days work involves alot of data science work, I have managed to automate most processes at work

* This file was written in Vim :-).
