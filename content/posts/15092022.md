## Day 1 of 107

The project has already began.

There are alot of similar project online mostly about 100DaysofCode.

The goal of my project is not only learning coding skills but also the necessary tools and soft skills that come along with it.

I will start off with 1.5 hours of coding per day and progress on with it.

The best way to learn something is to play with it.

## This Site

This site is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_server/). Hugo is a high performance static web generator which is
built using Go.

I chose this as the blog for the project. While most updates shall be here, projects mentioned here will be on my main site [Githuka.com](https://www.githuka.com)

Its my intention to keep this side clutter free and light weight.

Most stuff shall be happening in the back end to give you the reader a pleasant reading time.
